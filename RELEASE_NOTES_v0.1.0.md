## 💾 Downloads

**File:** `CppLabEngine-v0.1.0-win64.zip`

**Size:** ~500-800 MB (includes compilers)

**SHA256:** (will be added after build)

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Download** the zip file from this release
2. **Extract** to any folder (e.g., `C:\CppLabEngine`)
3. **Run** `CppLabEngine.exe`
4. **Create** a new project or open a standalone .cpp file
5. **Build** with F7 or Build & Run with F5

No installation wizard. No admin rights needed after extraction.

## 📋 Requirements

- **OS:** Windows 10 or Windows 11 (64-bit)
- **Disk Space:** ~1.5 GB after extraction
- **RAM:** 2 GB minimum, 4 GB recommended
- **No additional software needed** - compilers are bundled

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- **Windows only** - Linux and macOS support planned for future releases
- **No debugger** - Use external GDB for now (integrated debugger planned)
- **Build performance** - May be slow with active antivirus
  - **Solution:** Add CppLabEngine folder to antivirus exclusions
- **Graphics + OpenMP** - Cannot be used together in one project
  - Graphics requires 32-bit compiler
  - OpenMP works better with 64-bit compiler

### Workarounds
- For debugging: Use GDB from command line with compiled executables
- For faster builds: Exclude CppLabEngine folder in Windows Defender
- For both graphics and OpenMP: Create separate projects

## 📚 Documentation

### Included Guides
- Getting Started
